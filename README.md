*DESCRIPTION*
THE CLIENT-SERVER CHAT APPLICATION YOU BUILT USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING IS A COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL EXAMPLE OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE USERS. IT CONSISTS OF TWO SEPARATE JAVA PROGRAMS: CHATSERVER AND CHATCLIENT, WHICH TOGETHER ENABLE USERS TO EXCHANGE MESSAGES OVER A NETWORK IN REAL TIME. THIS SETUP DEMONSTRATES THE FUNDAMENTALS OF NETWORK PROGRAMMING, SOCKET COMMUNICATION, AND MULTITHREADED SERVER DESIGN IN JAVA.

THE CHATSERVER PROGRAM IS THE CENTRAL HUB THAT MANAGES ALL CLIENT CONNECTIONS. IT USES A SERVERSOCKET TO LISTEN FOR INCOMING CONNECTION REQUESTS ON A SPECIFIED PORT (12345). WHEN A NEW CLIENT CONNECTS, THE SERVER ACCEPTS THE CONNECTION AND CREATES A NEW CLIENTHANDLER OBJECT. THIS CLIENTHANDLER IMPLEMENTS THE RUNNABLE INTERFACE AND RUNS IN A SEPARATE THREAD, ALLOWING THE SERVER TO HANDLE MULTIPLE CLIENTS CONCURRENTLY WITHOUT BLOCKING OTHER CONNECTIONS. THIS DESIGN ENSURES THAT EACH CLIENT CAN SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES INDEPENDENTLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY.

THE SERVER MAINTAINS A SET OF ALL ACTIVE CLIENTHANDLER INSTANCES. THIS SET IS USED TO BROADCAST MESSAGES TO ALL CONNECTED CLIENTS. WHEN A CLIENT SENDS A MESSAGE, THE SERVER RELAYS (BROADCASTS) THAT MESSAGE TO EVERY OTHER CLIENT EXCEPT THE SENDER. THIS REAL-TIME BROADCASTING MECHANISM IS WHAT ALLOWS ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE CHAT ROOM TO SEE MESSAGES AS SOON AS THEY ARE SENT. THE SERVER ALSO HANDLES CLIENT DISCONNECTIONS GRACEFULLY BY REMOVING THE CLIENTHANDLER FROM THE ACTIVE SET AND NOTIFYING OTHER USERS THAT SOMEONE HAS LEFT THE CHAT.

THE CLIENTHANDLER CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH A SINGLE CLIENT. WHEN A NEW CLIENT CONNECTS, THE HANDLER PROMPTS THEM TO ENTER A USERNAME, WHICH IS THEN USED TO IDENTIFY THEIR MESSAGES IN THE CHAT. THE HANDLER READS MESSAGES FROM THE CLIENT USING A BUFFEREDREADER AND SENDS MESSAGES USING A PRINTWRITER. IT CONTINUOUSLY LISTENS FOR INPUT UNTIL THE CLIENT TYPES "EXIT," AT WHICH POINT IT CLEANS UP RESOURCES AND NOTIFIES THE SERVER OF THE DISCONNECTION.

ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE CHATCLIENT PROGRAM ALLOWS A USER TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER USING A SOCKET POINTING TO THE SERVER'S ADDRESS AND PORT. IT USES A PRINTWRITER TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE SERVER AND A BUFFEREDREADER TO RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM THE SERVER. TO ACHIEVE REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION, THE CLIENT STARTS A SEPARATE THREAD THAT LISTENS FOR MESSAGES FROM THE SERVER AND PRINTS THEM TO THE USERâ€™S CONSOLE. THIS DESIGN ENSURES THAT THE USER CAN SEE INCOMING MESSAGES EVEN WHILE TYPING NEW ONES.

THE CLIENT PROMPTS THE USER TO TYPE MESSAGES IN THE CONSOLE AND SENDS THEM TO THE SERVER. USERS CAN TYPE "EXIT" TO DISCONNECT FROM THE CHAT. ERROR HANDLING IS INCLUDED TO DEAL WITH COMMON ISSUES SUCH AS SERVER UNAVAILABILITY OR NETWORK ERRORS, PROVIDING CLEAR MESSAGES TO THE USER IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

OVERALL, THIS JAVA CHAT APPLICATION FULLY DEMONSTRATES THE REQUIREMENT TO BUILD A CLIENT-SERVER CHAT APPLICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE USERS. IT ALLOWS MANY USERS TO CONNECT, SEND, AND RECEIVE MESSAGES IN REAL TIME, WHILE SHOWCASING GOOD PRACTICES IN NETWORK PROGRAMMING, THREAD MANAGEMENT, AND ERROR HANDLING. THIS PROJECT SERVES AS AN EXCELLENT FOUNDATION FOR MORE COMPLEX FEATURES SUCH AS PRIVATE MESSAGING, USER AUTHENTICATION, OR EVEN A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE IN FUTURE VERSIONS.
